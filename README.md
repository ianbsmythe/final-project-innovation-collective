## ➤ Project Outline

### Problem Statement

Loneliness is more prolific in today’s society than ever before. Gen Z, Millennials, and elderly individuals report experiencing high levels of social isolation. Gen Z is said to be the loneliest generation of all time. 22% of Millennials say they have zero friends. And old age loneliness is the highest it's ever been. Existing social media platforms lack focus on building lasting and meaningful connections based on mutual interest and locality.

### Solution

A socially responsible social app that fosters community by helping like-minded individuals find and connect with others within their locality based on shared interests, hobbies, and activities. Our app would be aimed at building communities and life-long friendships, both remotely and in-person.

### Approach

- A mobile-first, responsive designed web application.

## ➤ MVPs

### MVP1
  -   A profile page (based on session authentication initially) containing:
    - Profile picture placeholder (use the user's initials as a profile picture to start with)
    - Email address
    - Name
    - Surname
    - Display Name
    - Location
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Bio
    - Interests (should be able to add multiple interests)
    - Database (for storing profiles, group chats, etc.) using a pre-built service like Supabase's Database service. Supabase databases come with their own auto-generated Data APIs, allowing you to easily create, read, update, and delete data in them. More info here.
